								Hi My Name is Nils. <br>
								I am 24 years old and was born and raised near Freiburg and the Black Forest. 
								After my time in school and the Completion of the Abitur I started my Studies <a href="https://www.kit.edu/">@KIT</a>. 
								And so I began to study in the Bachelor Program of Industrial Engineering and Management in the year of 2017. 
								During this time a pursued two Internships and consluded my Bachelor with my Thesis with the topic: "A Descriptive Analysis of Impact Categories in Entrepreneurial Ecosystems"
								A small documentation of my Bachelor Thesis topic is presented on the following website: <a href="https://nenils.github.io/impact_categories">Impact Categories Overview</a>

								<h2>University Projects</h2>

							<header>
								<h4>Bachelor</h4>
							</header>

							
							<p style="text-align: justify;">In addition to my work experience, I was also able to expand and improve my skills and abilities. 
								It started with smaller group projects in the Bachelor's program. 
								These included a project on EBSS (use of business standard software), in which we were allowed to model processes in Horus Business Modeler using fictitious but realistic company data. 
								We also had the opportunity to use the data mining and process mining software Celonis in this subject. 
								The course introduces us to very different topics, which is why the next project was a team project in Marketing. 
								The aim of the project was to develop a marketing strategy for a software product in the health sector. 
								I completed my Bachelor's degree with my Bachelor's thesis. I wrote this with a focus on the start-up scene. 
								I spent five months reading up on the various players in the ecosystem that focus on promoting start-ups with impact. 
								But what exactly is meant by impact was part of my work. Which startups do the players consider to be sustainable or have an impact focus? Are there groups that appear together again and again? 
								Over the five months, I built up a data set and subsequently analyzed it to identify three groups of categories. 
								However, the results can be looked up in more detail on the corresponding <a href="https://nenils.github.io/impact_categories">website.</a>

									<h4>Master</h4>

							<p style="text-align: justify;">
								Another chapter I was able to open in the Master's program. 
				
								<iframe src="material/Team_Pregnancy_Intermed_Pres.pdf" width="476" height="288" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" style="float: left ; padding: 30px;"></iframe>
								Here I was able to gain even more practical experience in various areas of Industrial Engineering & Management studies. 
								These ranged from a seminar paper in economics to an internship in additive manufacturing processes. 
								In the seminar paper, we developed an experiment that could prove that a chatbot for pregnant families would help reduce the overload of midwives. 
								As you can see on the left, we have summarized this in a paper, which you can also access there. 
								<br>
								<br>
								<img src="./images/Bottle_Cage_acros.jpeg" alt="" width="300"style="float: right; padding: 30px; padding-top: 30px ;padding-left: 30px;padding-bottom: 30px;">
								
								In contrast to the seminar paper, we were able to design a component from scratch in the practical course on additive manufacturing. 
								The task was to design a bottle cage for bicycles, simulate additive manufacturing, post-process it and test the quality and compare it with subtractive or other conventional processes. 
								It should also be emphasized that the design was developed generative from the load construction by nTopolog. 
								The picture below shows the design and the finished printed bottle holder. 
								<img src="./images/Bottle_Cage_top.jpeg" alt="" width="400" style="float: left; padding-top: 30px ;padding-right: 30px;padding-bottom: 30px;">

							<p style="text-align: justify;">
								One of the projects where I was able to learn a lot was the lecture Artificial intelligence in Service Systems, Applications in Computer Vision. 
								Here we were allowed to come up with a use case for computer vision and then develop it according to the CRISP-DM model. 
								From generating the images to creating a front-end interface for the application. 
								And afterward I documented our work on a website which you can find here. 
								<iframe src="https://cvgruppe3.github.io/doc/" width="720" height="405" frameborder="0" scrolling="yes" style="float: right ; padding: 30px;">This is the Documentation to <a href="https://cvgruppe3.github.io/doc/">Grocery Vision</a> </iframe>

								<br>
								<br>
								<br>
								<br>
								<br>
								<br>
								The biggest project in the Master's program was my participation in Service Design Thinking. 
								This is an applied Design Thinking course based on the world-renowned ME310 course at Stanford University. 
								Over 9 months, I worked on the challenges of a corporate partner in the International SUGAR Network using various methods from the Design Thinking manual. 
								However, I was not alone, but part of an international interdisciplinary team. 
								Our final prototype after the 9 months was a software that predicts the energy consumption of industrial cooling systems and then reduces the carbon dioxide according to the energy mix. 
								We were able to present this prototype in San Francisco in June 2023.

							<p style="text-align: justify;">	
								Overall, I can say that I learned a lot during the 9 months in terms of project work, tackling uncertain problems and presenting results to different target groups. 
								All other projects, events or contacts to the SUGAR Network can be found <a href="https://sugar-network.org/">here</a>.
								<br>
								<br>
								<br>

								For my Master's degree, I also took a technically applied course at the KIT's Institute of Production Technology. 
								The course dealt with the practical implementation of AI models in a production context. 
								In detail, we got a NASA Milling data set in a group of 5 students. 
								This gives the time series and the associated wear of the milling flank of an industrial milling machine. 
								Subsequently, we analyzed the data, extracted and generated features and then selected the most meaningful ones based on several results to train an RNN. 
								We then fine-tuned the RNN using the optuna library. 
								The exact procedure can be viewed here on the left in the slide deck gallery. 

								<iframe src="./material/VorhersageDesVerschleissesDurchRNN_3_Gruppe_4.pdf" width="720" height="405" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" style="float: left ; padding: 30px;" ></iframe>
								<br>
								<br>
								<br>

								Academic writing is one of the core elements of a university. 
								This was not only learned theoretically in the "Digital health" course, but also put into practice directly. 
								In our topic, we investigated whether the introduction of computer vision-supported diagnoses in healthcare would change the organizational identity. 
								To this end, we interviewed various experts who would be affected by this, transcribed the interviews and then evaluated them against our research question. 
								Our paper was subsequently published here <a href="https://publikationen.bibliothek.kit.edu/1000162331"> DOI: 10.5445/IR/1000162178
								</a>.

						<p style="text-align: justify;">
							To showcase another aspect of my personality, I would like to introduce the activities that play a major role in my life alongside my work and studies. 
							In general, I have to say that I love sport. 
							Since I was young, I've always done sport as long as I wasn't injured. 
							I discovered cycling at the beginning of my studies. 
							The pandemic has increased my commitment and I also spend the odd vacation on my bike. 
							Besides that, I played soccer and tennis for a long time, tried golf and lacrosse and I couldn't keep my hands off judo either. 
							To sum up, I like to spend my time being active, preferably in the great outdoors.
